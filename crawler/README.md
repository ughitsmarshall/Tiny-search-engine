# Tiny Search Engine Crawler
## Created by Marshall Carey-Matthews

## Structure

The structure of this web crawler follows the requirements, design, and implementation in the CS50 public repsitory. There are no known limitations.

## Assumptions (IMPORTANT!!)

- The user should note that the crawling address must use the HTTP protocol and no other protocol, including HTTPS.
- The code assumes that the user is using a UNIX system, where the directory dividers are "/" and not "\". The user may or may not enter the "/" in directory arguments, if they so choose.
