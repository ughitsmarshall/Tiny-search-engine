# Tiny Search Engine Indexer
## Created by Marshall Carey-Matthews

## Structure

The structure of this web indexer follows the requirements, design, and implementation in the CS50 public repository. There are no known limitations.

## Assumptions

- The code assumes that the user is using a UNIX system, where the directory dividers are "/" and not "\". The user may or may not enter the "/" in directory arguments, if they so choose.
